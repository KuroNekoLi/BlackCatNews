It's a very painful way to learn.\"\n\nThe Electoral Commission oversees elections and regulates political finance in the UK to ensure the integrity of the democratic process.\n\nMr Rangarajan was not CEO when the hack happened but says that colleagues described the chaos of discovering the hackers as \"feeling like you'd been burgled whilst still inside the house\".\n\nThe hackers first breach was in August 2021, using a security flaw in a popular software programme called Microsoft Exchange. The digital hole was being exploited by suspected Chinese spies around the world and organisations were being warned to download a software patch to protect themselves.\n\nDespite months of warnings, the commission failed to do so.\n\nHackers had access to the full open electoral register containing the names and addresses of all 40m UK voters.\n\nThey could also read every email sent and received at the commission.\n\nThe criminals weren't found until October 2022 during a password system upgrade.\n\nCyber security failures\n\nNot keeping software up to date was one of several basic security mistakes made including having bad password practices, failing a basic government-run security audit and ignoring advice from the National Cyber Security Centre.\n\nThe Information Commissioner's office issued a formal reprimand to the Electoral Commission but if equivalent mistakes were made in a private sector breach it would likely have led to a large fine.\n\nMr Rangarajan says that as well as the reprimand, stakeholders including in parliament were shocked by the complacency and asked \"what were you doing?\"\n\nNo individual person has been publicly reprimanded for the security lapses.\n\nThere were six by-elections during the period that hackers were inside the commission's IT networks but there is no evidence that anything was affected by it.\n\nHowever the commission says it still doesn't know what the hackers were doing or what information they may have downloaded.\n\nMr Rangarajan admits that the hackers could have caused major disruption if they have installed malicious software or hampered communications during an election.\n\n\"All of this could have caused us amazing problems. It was a dangerous thing to have happened,\" he said.\n\nChinese spies were blamed for the attack and received sanctions from British and US authorities. China has always denied any involvement.\n\nMr Rangarajan said staff at the time didn't seem to think the commission would be targeted by hackers. This was despite high profile elections interference cases like the 2016 US presidential election hack of Hilary Clinton's emails.\n\n\"I don't think everyone realised quite how much democratic systems and electoral systems were targets. We tended to be quite comfortable in the way we runs things. We now have to be really up to speed with the threats,\" he said.\n\nThe Electoral Commission was given grants of more then £250,000 to recover from the breach and now says it is spending significantly more of its budget on cyber security.\n\nIt has now passed the National Cyber Security Centre's Cyber Essentials certification – the audit that an insider told the BBC it had failed in the build up to the hack.

Images\n\n英國的選舉監管機構表示，從一場駭客攻擊中完全恢復花了三年時間，並至少花費了二十五萬英鎊，這場攻擊使得四千萬選民的私人資料被中國網絡間諜獲取。\n\n去年，選舉委員會因一連串的安全失誤而被公開譴責，這些失誤使得駭客組織在未被察覺的情況下進行間諜活動，入侵了數據庫和電子郵件系統。\n\n在關於這次駭客攻擊的首次採訪中，委員會的新負責人承認犯下了巨大的錯誤，但表示該組織現在已經安全。\n\n\"整件事情是一個巨大的震驚，基本上我們花了好幾年才從中恢復過來，\"首席執行官Vijay Rangarajan說。\n\n\"這裡的文化現在已經發生了顯著的變化，部分原因是這次事件。這是一種非常痛苦的學習方式。\"\n\n選舉委員會負責監督英國的選舉並規範政治資金，以確保民主過程的完整性。\n\nRangarajan先生在駭客攻擊發生時並不是首席執行官，但他表示，同事們形容發現駭客的混亂情況就像是\"在家裡還在的時候被入室盜竊\"。\n\n駭客的首次入侵發生在2021年8月，利用了一個名為Microsoft Exchange的流行軟件程序中的安全漏洞。這個數字漏洞被懷疑是中國間諜在全球範圍內利用的，組織被警告要下載軟件補丁來保護自己。\n\n儘管有數月的警告，委員會未能這樣做。\n\n駭客可以訪問包含所有四千萬英國選民姓名和地址的完整公開選舉登記冊。\n\n他們還可以閱讀委員會發送和接收的每封電子郵件。\n\n直到2022年10月在密碼系統升級期間，才發現這些犯罪分子。\n\n網絡安全失誤\n\n未能保持軟件更新是幾個基本安全錯誤之一，包括糟糕的密碼實踐，未通過政府運行的基本安全審核，並忽視國家網絡安全中心的建議。\n\n信息專員辦公室向選舉委員會發出了正式譴責，但如果在私營部門發生類似錯誤，可能會導致巨額罰款。\n\nRangarajan先生表示，除了譴責外，包括議會在內的利益相關者對這種自滿感到震驚，並問道\"你們在做什麼？\"\n\n沒有任何個人因安全失誤而被公開譴責。\n\n在駭客進入委員會的IT網絡期間，共有六次補選，但沒有證據表明任何事情受到影響。\n\n然而，委員會表示仍然不知道駭客在做什麼或可能下載了什麼信息。\n\nRangarajan先生承認，如果駭客安裝了惡意軟件或在選舉期間妨礙了通信，他們可能會造成重大破壞。\n\n\"所有這些都可能給我們帶來驚人的問題。這是一件危險的事情，\"他說。\n\n中國間諜被指責為這次攻擊的元兇，並受到英國和美國當局的制裁。中國一直否認任何參與。\n\nRangarajan先生表示，當時的員工似乎不認為委員會會成為駭客的目標。這儘管有高調的選舉干預案件，如2016年美國總統選舉希拉里·克林頓電子郵件被駭事件。\n\n\"我不認為每個人都意識到民主系統和選舉系統是多麼大的目標。我們往往對我們的運行方式感到相當自滿。我們現在必須真正跟上威脅，\"他說。\n\n選舉委員會獲得了超過25萬英鎊的補助金來從這次入侵中恢復，現在表示其預算中有顯著更多的資金用於網絡安全。\n\n它現在已通過國家網絡安全中心的網絡基本認證——一位內部人士告訴BBC，它在駭客攻擊前未能通過的審核。它還獲得了網絡基本認證加——該計劃的最高級別認證。\n\n更多關於這個故事\n\n選舉登記冊上的網絡攻擊被揭露\n\n糟糕的安全讓駭客訪問了四千萬選民的詳細信息\n\n註冊我們的Tech

Ferrari's Lewis Hamilton was fourth fastest.\n\nIt is not expected that Aston Martin will be contenders for pole position. However, the team are optimistic of a better weekend on a low-speed track that is more suited to their car, which runs more competitively when high levels of downforce are required.\n\nTwo-time champion Alonso is also renowned as a Singapore specialist, and usually excels on the Marina Bay street track. But he was likely running less fuel or a higher engine mode than his rivals, or both, to set such a quick time.\n\nHis team-mate Lance Stroll was 1.918secs slower in 18th place. The Canadian had problems with his seat early in the session and was also running test items.\n\nThe first session in Singapore is not representative of conditions later in the weekend as it is run in daylight in late afternoon, while qualifying and the race are held after dark.\n\nPiastri leads Norris by 25 points with seven races to go heading into the weekend in Singapore, while McLaren are poised to clinch the constructors' championship on Sunday.\n\nThe only way they can not tie it up in Singapore is if Mercedes outscore them by 31 points or Ferrari do so by 35.\n\nRed Bull are optimistic of a positive weekend after Verstappen's victories in Monza and Baku leading into this weekend, and were relieved when light rain falling before the session abated by the time the cars went out on a track that had remained dry.\n\nMotorsport adviser Helmut Marko said before the session that they needed a dry hour to make a comprehensive start on understanding their set-up for the weekend.","cleaned_text_zh":"Getty ImagesAndrew BensonF1 特派員在新加坡43分鐘前56條評論\n\n新加坡大獎賽10月3日至5日，週日下午13:00 BST開始比賽。可在Sounds上收聽，BBC Radio 5 Sports Extra和Sports Extra 2提供現場評論；BBC

jdlrvG\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ\">Two former Meta safety researchers told a US Senate committee on Tuesday that the social media giant covered up potential harms to children stemming from its virtual reality (VR) products.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ\">\"Meta has chosen to ignore the problems they created and bury evidence of users' negative experiences,\" said Jason Sattizahn.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ\">The hearing comes a day after the Washington Post reported the whistleblowers' allegations that Meta lawyers intervened to shape internal research that could have flagged risks.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ\">Meta, the parent company of Facebook, Instagram, and WhatsApp, denies the allegations and in a statement referred to the \"claims at the heart\" of the hearing as \"nonsense.\"</p></div><div data-testid=\"ad-unit\" data-component=\"ad-slot\" class=\"sc-1b734f04-0 clMRbk\"><div data-testid=\"dotcom-mid_1\" id=\"dotcom-mid_1\" class=\"dotcom-ad\"></div></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 jdlrvG\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ\">Mr Sattizahn and Cayce Savage, who once lead research on the youth user experience for Meta's VR platforms, told senators that the company demanded researchers erase evidence of sexual abuse risk on those products.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ\">They also alleged the company told in-house researchers to avoid work that could produce evidence of harm from its VR products to children.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ\">Ahead of the hearing, Meta knocked back the allegations.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ\">The claims, the company said, are \"based on selectively leaked internal documents that were picked specifically to craft a false narrative.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ\">There were also no bans or limits on carrying out research, a spokesperson added – saying the company has in recent years approved \"nearly 180 Reality Labs-related studies on issues including youth safety and well-being.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ\">Mr Sattizahn, who worked at the company from 2018 to 2024, responded in testimony to the committee by calling Meta's response to the Washington Post report a \"lie by avoidance.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ\">\"It's pointing out some rote number that means nothing,\" he said, insisting that Meta's research is being \"pruned and manipulated.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ\">During one exchange with US Senator John Hawley, a Republican from Missouri, Ms Savage alleged that during her research, she identified that Roblox, the online game platform popular among children, was being used by coordinated paedophile rings.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ\">\"They set up strip clubs and they pay children to strip\" with Robux, the app's currency, which can be converted into real money, Ms Savage said.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ\">\"I flagged this to Meta and said that under no circumstances should we host the app Roblox on their headset,\" Ms Savage said. Roblox is still available in the Meta VR app store, she noted.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ\">Roblox told the BBC it strongly disagreed with the allegations made on Tuesday, saying they were \"based on ill-informed and outdated information\". </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ\">\"At Roblox, safety is a top priority,\" a company spokesperson said. \"We work tirelessly to remove violative content and bad actors from the platform through our 24/7 moderation system and respond swiftly to abuse reports, including banning accounts and reporting to law enforcement.\" </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ\">Meta offers parental supervision tools on its Quest headsets, as well as on the VR game, Horizon Worlds. These allow parents and guardians to see and adjust safety features and track which other players their children follow and are followed by.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ\">But during the hearing, Republican Senator Ashley Moody of Florida said she was unable to navigate the parental controls despite being one of the first attorneys general in the country to sue Meta in court for allegedly harming children online.  </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ\">\"It doesn't surprise you that someone like me who has all this knowledge had to go to my own child and say 'how do I find the parental controls?'\" she asked the former researchers.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ\">\"Not at all,\" they both responded.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ\">Mr Sattizahn and Ms Savage are just the latest former Meta employees to come forward with explosive allegations about the company. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ\">In 2021, Frances Haugen who once worked as a product manager on the company's civic integrity team, <a target=\"_self\" href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-58784615\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 jZoZnB\">said</a> Instagram was impacting the mental health of teenagers but did not share its own findings suggesting that the platform was a \"toxic\" place for many youngsters.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ\">Ms Haugen had copied a trove of internal memos and documents prior to departing the company.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ\">Meta boss Mark Zuckerberg said that the time that her claims that Meta prioritizes profit above safety are \"just not true\".</p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 jdlrvG\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ\">Mr Zuckerberg has also faced repeated questioning by US lawmakers who claim that the company pushes harmful content to young users.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ\">At a Senate hearing last year, after being prodding by Senator Hawley, Mr Zuckerberg apologised to families who claimed their loved ones had been harmed by the company's products. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ\">Several of them were sitting in the audience behind him.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0

<p>Sattizahn 和 Cayce Savage 曾領導 Meta VR 平台的青少年用戶體驗研究，他們告訴參議員，公司要求研究人員刪除這些產品上性虐待風險的證據。</p>\n  <p>他們還指控公司告訴內部研究人員避免進行可能產生兒童 VR 產品危害證據的工作。</p>\n  <p>在聽證會前，Meta 駁回了這些指控。</p>\n  <p>公司表示，這些指控是「基於選擇性洩露的內部文件，這些文件是專門挑選來編造虛假敘述的。」</p>\n  <p>發言人補充說，進行研究也沒有禁令或限制——公司近年來已批准「近 180 項與 Reality Labs 相關的研究，涉及青少年安全和福祉等問題。」</p>\n  <p>在 2018 年至 2024 年間在公司工作的 Sattizahn 在向委員會作證時回應《華盛頓郵報》報導，稱

The plan proposes an immediate end to military operations, with Hamas releasing 20 living Israeli hostages and the remains of more than two dozen hostages who are believed to be dead within 72 hours, in exchange for hundreds of detained Gazans.\n\nA Palestinian source familiar with the ceasefire negotiations told the BBC that Hamas officials have been given the White House's 20-point proposal. It demands that Hamas will have no role in governing Gaza and leaves the door open for an eventual Palestinian state.\n\nSpeaking at a news conference following talks at the White House, Trump called the plan \"a historic day for peace\". But he said that Netanyahu will have US backing to do what he has to do if Hamas does not agree to the plan. Netanyahu then said Israel \"will finish the job\" if Hamas rejects the plan or does not follow through.\n\nBritish Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer welcomed the plan, saying, \"We call on all sides to come together and to work with the US Administration to finalize this agreement and bring it into reality. Hamas should now agree to the plan and end the misery, by laying down their arms and releasing all remaining hostages.\"\n\nThe proposal, if followed, would begin with the immediate cessation of military operations. It also says existing \"battle lines\" would be frozen in place until conditions are met for a staged withdrawal. Under the plan, Hamas would lay down its arms and its tunnels and weapon production facilities would be destroyed.\n\nThe plan also says once the 20 living Israeli hostages and the remains of hostages who are believed to be dead are released, Israel would then release hundreds of detained Gazans. For every Israeli hostage whose remains are released, Israel will release the remains of 15 dead Gazans, the plan says. It also adds that once both sides agree to the proposal \"full aid will be immediately sent into the Gaza Strip\".\n\nThe US also outlines its plan for the future governance of Gaza. It says a \"technocratic, apolitical Palestinian committee\" will govern temporarily \"with oversight and supervision by a new international transitional body, called the Board of Peace, which will be headed\" by Trump. Former UK PM Tony Blair, and other leaders \"to be announced\", would also be part of the governing body. Blair called the plan \"bold and intelligent\". The plan adds that Hamas must have no role in governance, \"directly, indirectly, or in any form\".\n\nMuch of the plan is focused on what the US calls an \"economic development plan\" to rebuild Gaza. It also says \"Israel will not occupy or annex Gaza\" and its forces will withdraw from the territory in stages over time.\n\nIn a shift from Trump's earlier statements, Palestinians will not be forced to leave Gaza and instead, the document said: \"We will encourage people to stay and offer them the opportunity to build a better Gaza.\" The plan also leaves the door open to an eventual Palestinian state.\n\nA Palestinian source familiar with the ceasefire negotiations told the BBC \"Qatari and Egyptian officials have handed over the White House plan to end the war in Gaza to Hamas officials in Doha\". Earlier, a senior Hamas official told the BBC that the group remained open to studying any proposal that could end the war in Gaza, but stressed that any agreement must safeguard Palestinian interests, ensure a full Israeli withdrawal from Gaza and bring the war to an end.\n\nAsked about the group's weapons, the official said: \"The weapons of the resistance are a red line as long as the occupation continues.\" The issue of arms can only be discussed within the framework of a political solution that guarantees the establishment of an independent Palestinian state on the 1967 borders.\n\nThe announcement of the plan comes just days after Netanyahu attacked the recognition of a Palestinian state by multiple Western countries during a combative speech at the UN General Assembly. Netanyahu labelled the recognition moves a \"mark of shame\" that sent the message that \"murdering Jews pays off\". Dozens of officials and diplomats staged a walk-out as he took to the podium, leaving large parts of the conference hall empty.\n\nWhile Trump has staunchly backed Netanyahu since returning to the White House for a second term, he has become increasingly frustrated with him in recent weeks. Trump expressed annoyance at Israel's recent strike on Hamas members in key US ally Qatar. Before Monday's news conference, Netanyahu called Prime Minister Mohammed bin Abdulrahman bin Jassim al-Thani of Qatar from the White House to express his deep regret that Israel's missile strike unintentionally killed a Qatari serviceman.\n\nThe Israeli military launched a campaign in Gaza in response to the Hamas-led attack on southern Israel on 7 October 2023, in which about 1,200 people were killed and 251 others were taken hostage. At least 66,055 people have been killed in Israeli attacks in Gaza since then, according to the territory's Hamas-run health ministry.\n\nA UN-backed body recently confirmed that famine was taking place in Gaza City. Earlier this month, a UN commission of inquiry concluded that Israel had committed genocide in Gaza - which Israel strongly rejects.","cleaned_text_zh":"美國總統唐納德·特朗普和以色列總理本雅明·內塔尼亞胡表示，他們已經同意了一項新的加沙和平計劃，並警告哈馬斯接受該計劃。該計劃提議立即停止軍事行動，哈馬斯需在72小時內釋放20名活著的以色列人質及超過兩打被認為已死亡的人質遺體，以換取數百名被拘留的加沙人。\n\n一位熟悉停火談判的巴勒斯坦消息人士告訴BBC，哈馬斯官員已收到白宮的20點提案。該提案要求哈馬斯不參與加沙的治理，並為最終建立巴勒斯坦國家留出空間。\n\n在白宮會談後的新聞發布會上，特朗普稱該計劃是“和平的歷史性一天”。但他表示，如果哈馬斯不同意該計劃，內塔尼亞胡將獲得美國的支持來採取必要行動。內塔尼亞胡隨後表示，如果哈馬斯拒絕該計劃或不履行承諾，以色列將“完成任務”。\n\n英國首相基爾·斯塔默爵士對該計劃表示歡迎，稱“我們呼籲各方共同努力，與美國政府合作，完成這項協議並將其付諸現實。哈馬斯現在應該同意該計劃，結束痛苦，放下武器並釋放所有剩餘的人質。”\n\n如果遵循該提案，將從立即停止軍事行動開始。它還表示，現有的“戰線”將凍結，直到滿足條件以進行分階段撤軍。根據該計劃，哈馬斯將放下武器，其隧道和武器生產設施將被摧毀。\n\n該計劃還表示，一旦釋放20名活著的以色列人質及被認為已死亡的人質遺體，以色列將釋放數百名被拘留的加沙人。對於每名釋放遺體的以色列人質，以色列將釋放15名死去的加沙人的遺體。該計劃還補充說，一旦雙方同意該提案，“全面援助將立即送入加沙地帶”。\n\n美國還概述了其對加沙未來治理的計劃。它表示，一個“技術官僚、非政治的巴勒斯坦委員會”將暫時治理加沙，“由一個新的國際過渡機構監督，稱為和平委員會，由特朗普領導”。前英國首相托尼·布萊爾和其他“待宣布”的領導人也將成為治理機構的一部分。布萊爾稱該計劃“勇敢而聰明”。該計劃補充說，哈馬斯不得以任何形式參與治理。\n\n該計劃的大部分重點是美國所稱的“經濟發展計劃”，以重建加沙。它還表示“以色列不會佔領或吞併加沙”，其部隊將分階段撤出該地區。\n\n與特朗普早先的聲明有所不同，巴勒斯坦人不會被迫離開加沙，相反，文件指出：“我們將鼓勵人們留下來，並為他們提供建設更好加沙的機會。”該計劃還為最終建立巴勒斯坦國家留出空間。\n\n一位熟悉停火談判的巴勒斯坦消息人士告訴BBC，“卡塔爾和埃及官員已將白宮計劃交給多哈的哈馬斯官員，以結束加沙的戰爭”。此前，一名高級哈馬斯官員告訴BBC，該組織仍然願意研究任何可能結束加沙戰爭的提案，但強調任何協議必須保障巴勒斯坦的利益，確保以色列完全撤出加沙並結束戰爭。\n\n當被問及該組織的武器時，該官員表示：“只要佔領繼續，抵抗的武器就是紅線。”武器問題只能在保證建立1967年邊界上的獨立巴勒斯坦國的政治解決框架內討論。\n\n該計劃的宣布僅在內塔尼亞胡在聯合國大會上發表激烈演講，抨擊多個西方國家承認巴勒斯坦國家後幾天。內塔尼亞胡將承認行動標記為“恥辱的標誌”，傳達了“殺害猶太人有利可圖”的信息。當他走上講台時，數十名官員和外交官離席，留下會議廳的大部分空位。\n\n儘管特朗普自第二任期重返白宮以來一直堅定支持內塔尼亞胡，但近幾周來他對內塔尼亞胡越來越感到沮喪。特朗普對以色列最近對美國重要盟友卡塔爾的哈馬斯成員的襲擊表示不滿。在週一的新聞發布會之前，內塔尼亞胡從白宮致電卡塔爾首相穆罕默德·本·阿卜杜勒拉赫曼·本·賈西姆·阿勒塔尼，表達以色列導彈襲擊意外殺死一名卡塔爾軍人的深切遺憾。\n\n以色列軍方在2023年10月7日哈馬斯領導的對南以色列的襲擊中，約1200人被殺，251人被劫持後，對加沙發起了行動。根據哈馬斯運營的加沙地區衛生部的數據，自那以來，至少66,055人在以色列對加沙的襲擊中喪生。\n\n一個聯合國支持的機構最近確認加沙市發生了饑荒。本月早些時候，一個聯合國調查委員會得出結論，以色列在加沙犯下了種族滅絕罪，這一點以色列強烈否認。","explanation":{"vocabulary":[{"pos":"noun","word_en":"ceasefire","word_zh":"停火","definition_en":"A temporary suspension of fighting, typically one that is officially declared.","definition_zh":"通常是正式宣布的暫時停止戰鬥。","example_en":"The two sides agreed to a ceasefire to allow for peace talks.","example_zh":"雙方同意停火以進行和平談判。"},{"pos":"noun","word_en":"hostage","word_zh":"人質","definition_en":"A person seized or held as security for the fulfillment of a condition.","definition_zh":"被扣押或持有以作為履行某種條件的擔保的人。","example_en":"The kidnappers released the hostages after their demands were met.","example_zh":"綁匪在要求得到滿足後釋放了人質。"},{"pos":"adjective","word_en":"apolitical","word_zh":"非政治的","definition_en":"Not interested or involved in politics.","definition_zh":"對政治不感興趣或不參與政治的。","example_en":"The committee was formed to be apolitical and focus solely on humanitarian aid.","example_zh":"該委員會成立的目的是非政治化，專注於人道主義援助。"}],"grammar":[{"rule_en":"Conditional Sentences Type 1","explanation_en":"Used to talk about real and possible situations.

2018 年間護理的報告是在同事提出擔憂後委託的，發現他的做法存在缺陷，他的管理方式以及僅僅是「幸運避免了進一步的傷害」。</p>\n  <p>在週三報告發布後，NHS 信託表示對接受「低於預期標準」護理的女性「深感抱歉」。</p>\n  <p>該報告由婦科審查指導小組委託，其中包括 NHS 英格蘭、UHDB 和德比及德比郡臨床委員會小組的代表。</p>\n  <p>作為報告的一部分，小組聯繫了 2015 年至 2018 年間接受海伊先生治療的 325 名女性，要求她們分享經歷。</p>\n  <p>除了這 325 名患者外，還有 58 名女性已在 2019 年進行的早期評估中被審查。</p>\n  <p>在週三的報告中，指導小組小組確定有兩名女性在海伊先生的護理下遭受「嚴重的身體傷害」，三名女性遭受「中度身體傷害」。</p>\n  <p>發現的問題包括接受子宮切除術的女性——這是一種移除子宮的手術——一些患者被迫感覺這是她們的「唯一選擇」，而可能有更不具侵入性的選擇。</p>\n  <p>這「不利地影響了」那些夢想建立家庭但無法實現的女性的心理健康，影響了她們的關係和工作。</p>\n  <figure>\n    <img

年，顧問、手術室工作人員和管理人員就對海伊先生提出了擔憂，但小組表示「驚訝」的是，這些工作人員直到 2022 年才被信託面試——大約五年後。</p>\n  <h2>海伊先生的患者告訴審查什麼？</h2>\n  <p>報告發布了多名未具名女性的證詞。她們描述了被匆忙進行子宮切除術的情況。</p>\n  <ul>\n    <li>一名女性因月經過多而接受海伊先生的治療，報告稱，在沒有掃描或討論替代方案的情況下，經過 10 分鐘的諮詢後，她被建議進行子宮切除術。她說手術讓她感到疼痛，並患上焦慮和抑鬱。</li>\n    <li>另一名女性感覺她沒有其他選擇，只能進行子宮切除術——即使沒有進行檢查或掃描調查。她說：「這麼重大的手術是我唯一的選擇嗎？」</li>\n    <li>一名女性發現海伊先生「不穩定」。她告訴小組：「我記得海伊先生問，『你想要什麼？』我的回答是『我只想止血』。他立即拿出日曆告訴我『你可以在四月進行子宮切除術』。</li>\n    <li>一名患者問為什麼她必須進行開放性子宮切除術，而不是通過微創手術，當海伊先生回答「我喜歡切割」時，她感到震驚，報告稱。</li>\n    <li>同時，另一名患者補充道：「我再也不會踏入 NHS

<p>小組發現，只有因為「好同事的支持」和「幸運」才避免了進一步的傷害。</p>\n  <p>海伊先生現年 60 多歲，來自德比郡的阿爾弗雷頓，目前正在接受德比郡警方的調查，並於今年早些時候接受了警告下的面談。</p>\n  <p>他向警官談到了他在皇家德比醫院和里普利醫院進行的手術。</p>\n  <p>一位警方發言人說：「由於案件的複雜性，調查需要時間，但在整個調查過程中，我們一直與受影響者保持密切聯繫，並將在調查繼續時繼續這樣做。」</p>\n  <p>海伊先生已經四年多沒有正式對此事發表評論。</p>\n  <p>他在 2021 年 7 月的聲明中說：「我向 NHS 調查中受影響的女性道歉。我正在配合調查，但由於我持續的心理健康問題，請在此時尊重我的隱私。」</p>\n  <p>醫療防禦聯盟代表海伊先生在被 BBC 接觸時不願發表評論。</p>\n  <p>報告發布後，向信託提出了一系列建議，包括引入措施以「識別表現不佳的臨床醫生」，任何顧問都不應單獨工作，並且參加多學科團隊會議應該是臨床醫生的強制性要求。</p>\n  <p>它還呼籲信託投資更多的婦科支持，以支持其照顧下的女性。</p>\n  <p>另一項建議是信託應審查海伊先生 2015 年之前對女性的護理，這一建議現已被接受，目標是在秋季開始。</p>\n  <p>一旦準備就緒，信託將聯繫符合「第二階段」審查範圍的女性，邀請她們參加。</p>\n  <h2>「重要變革」</h2>\n  <p>第二份報告審查了當時 UHDB 信託的治理，並與對海伊先生護理的主要審查一起發布。</p>\n  <p>它表示，海伊先生自 2012 年以來的護理也應該被審查。</p>\n  <p>NHS 信託的執行首席醫療官吉斯·羅賓遜博士說：「我們想重申我們對接受海伊先生護理的女性的無保留道歉，這遠低於預期標準。</p>\n  <p>「在報告發布後，我們進行了重要的變革，制定了更清晰的同意程序和加強的臨床監督，以便能夠更快地識別護理問題，並改善女性的術後評估。</p>\n

Daniel Hay joined the University Hospitals of Derby and Burton (UHDB) NHS Foundation Trust in 2005, and operated on hundreds of women before retiring in 2020. A report - which scrutinised Mr Hay's care between 2015 and 2018 - was commissioned after concerns were raised by colleagues, and found failings in his practices, how he was managed and added only \"good fortune prevented further harm\".\n\nAfter publication of the report on Wednesday, the NHS trust said it was \"truly sorry\" to the women who received care \"below the standards expected\".

Mr Hay, who is in his 60s and from Alfreton in Derbyshire, is currently being investigated by Derbyshire Police and was interviewed under caution earlier this year.\n\nHe spoke to officers about the procedures he carried out at Royal Derby Hospital and Ripley Hospital. A police spokesperson said: \"Due to the complex nature of the case, inquiries have taken time, however, throughout the investigation we have remained in close contact with those affected and will continue to do so as the investigation continues.\"\n\nMr Hay has not officially commented on the matter for more than four years.

Following the report, a series of recommendations were made to the trust, including introducing measures to \"identify poorly performing clinicians\", that no consultant should work in isolation, and that attending multidisciplinary team meetings should be mandatory for clinicians.\n\nIt also called on the trust to invest in more gynaecological support for women under its care. Another recommendation was for the trust to review Mr Hay's care of women before 2015, which has now been accepted with the aim of starting in the autumn. Once ready, the trust will contact women who fall within the scope of the \"Phase 2\" review to invite them to take part.\n\n'Important changes' A second report, which reviewed governance at the UHDB trust at the time, was published alongside the major review into Mr Hay's care. It said Mr Hay's care from 2012 should also be reviewed.\n\nDr Gis Robinson, executive chief medical officer at the NHS trust, said: \"We want to reiterate our unreserved apologies to the women who received care from Mr Hay that was far below the standards expected.\"\n\nFollowing the report we made important changes, with clearer consent procedures and enhanced clinical oversight so any issues with care can be identified more quickly, and improved post-procedure reviews for women.

婦科醫生的冒險做法和捷徑導致女性遭受嚴重的身體傷害。Daniel Hay 於 2005 年加入德比和伯頓大學醫院 NHS 基金會信託，並在 2020 年退休前為數百名女性進行手術。報告對 Hay 先生在 2015 年至 2018 年間的護理進行了審查，該報告是在同事提出擔憂後委託的，發現了他在做法上的失誤、管理方式上的問題，並補充說只有 \"幸運\" 才能防止進一步的傷害。\n\n在週三報告發布後，NHS 信託表示對於接受 \"低於預期標準\" 的護理的女性 \"深感抱歉\"。該報告由婦科審查指導小組委託，其中包括 NHS 英格蘭、UHDB 和德比及德比郡臨床委員會小組的代表。\n\n作為報告的一部分，小組聯繫了 2015 年至 2018 年間由 Hay 先生治療的 325 名女性，要求她們分享她們的經歷。除了這 325 名患者外，還有 58 名女性已在 2019 年進行的早期評估中被審查。\n\n在週三的報告中，指導小組小組確定有兩名女性在 Hay 先生的護理下遭受 \"嚴重的身體傷害\"，三名女性遭受 \"中度的身體傷害\"。報告中指出的問題包括一些女性接受了子宮切除術——一種移除子宮的手術——有些患者被迫感覺這是她們的 \"唯一選擇\"，而可能有更不具侵入性的選擇可用。\n\n這 \"不利地影響\" 了那些夢想成家的女性的心理健康，因為她們無法這樣做，影響了她們的關係和工作。報告還發現 Hay 先生 \"表現出不良的臨床實踐\"，\"未能識別可能的風險\"，而僱用他的 NHS 信託 \"不知怎麼地允許這種情況持續，直到他最終因健康不佳而退休\"。\n\n他的同意過程——患者應能夠對手術做出知情決定——很差，他的記錄保存不充分，與患者的溝通經常是輕蔑的，報告補充說。早在 2017-18 年，顧問、劇場工作人員和經理就對 Hay 先生提出了擔憂，但小組表示 \"驚訝\"，這些工作人員直到 2022 年才被信託面試——大約五年後。\n\nHay 先生的患者告訴審查什麼？報告發布了多名女性的證詞，未透露姓名。她們描述了被匆忙進行子宮切除術。一名女性因月經過多而接受 Hay 先生的治療，並在 10 分鐘的諮詢後被提供子宮切除術，沒有進行掃描或討論其他選擇，報告說。她說手術讓她感到疼痛，患上焦慮和抑鬱。\n\n另一名女性感覺她沒有其他選擇，只能接受子宮切除術——即使沒有進行檢查或掃描調查。她說：\"這樣一個激進的重大手術是我唯一的選擇嗎？\" 一名女性發現 Hay 先生 \"不穩定\"。她告訴小組：\"我記得 Hay 先生問，'你想要什麼？' '我只想止血' 是我的回答。他立即拿出他的日記，告訴我 '你可以在四月進行子宮切除術'。\n\n一名患者問為什麼她必須進行開放式子宮切除術，而不是通過微創手術，當 Hay 先生回答 \"我喜歡切割\" 時，她感到震驚，報告說。與此同時，另一名患者補充說：\"我再也不會踏入 NHS 醫院。如果我的腿掉下來，我會自己截肢。\"\n\n在被審查的 325 名女性中，小組將每個案例分為紅色——重大關注——琥珀色——一些關注，或綠色——未發現任何問題。總共有 48 個案例被評為紅色，68 個琥珀色和 209 個綠色，儘管審查沒有明確定義問題的具體性質。\n\n小組發現，只有因為 \"好同事的支持\" 和 \"幸運\" 才能防止進一步的傷害。Hay 先生，現年 60 多歲，來自德比郡的 Alfreton，目前正在接受德比郡警方的調查，今年早些時候在警告下接受了面試。\n\n他向警官談到了他在皇家德比醫院和 Ripley 醫院進行的手術。一位警方發言人說：\"由於案件的複雜性，調查花費了時間，但在整個調查過程中，我們一直與受影響的人保持密切聯繫，並將繼續這樣做，直到調查結束。\"\n\nHay 先生已經超過四年沒有正式對此事發表評論。他在 2021 年 7 月的聲明中說：\"我向受到 NHS 調查影響的女性道歉。我正在配合調查，但由於我持續的心理健康問題，我請求您在此時尊重我的隱私。\"\n\n醫療辯護聯盟代表 Hay 先生在被 BBC 接觸時不願發表評論。報告發布後，對信託提出了一系列建議，包括引入措施 \"識別表現不佳的臨床醫生\"，任何顧問都不應單獨工作，並且參加多學科小組會議應成為臨床醫生的強制性要求。\n\n它還呼籲信託投資更多的婦科支持，以支持其照顧下的女性。另一項建議是信託應審查 Hay 先生在 2015 年之前對女性的護理，這已被接受，目標是在秋季開始。一旦準備就緒，信託將聯繫符合 \"第二階段\" 審查範圍的女性，邀請她們參加。\n\n\"重要變化\" 一份第二報告，審查了當時 UHDB 信託的治理，與對 Hay 先生護理的主要審查一起發布。它說 Hay 先生從 2012 年開始的護理也應該被審查。\n\nNHS 信託的執行首席醫療官 Gis Robinson 博士說：\"我們想重申我們對接受 Hay 先生護理的女性的無保留道歉，這遠低於預期標準。\"\n\n在報告發布後，我們做出了重要的改變，制定了更清晰的同意程序和增強的臨床監督，以便能夠更快地識別護理問題，並改善女性的術後評估。我們將繼續密切監控和審查這些措施，以確保它們有效並完全整合，並利用我們的學習來支持和指導審查的下一階段。\n\n分析 由 Rob Sissons，East Midlands 健康記者 報告充滿了數字，但當然，數字背後是那些因為糟糕的護理而說她們的關係被毀的女性的真實生活。\n\n我與參與審查的兩名女性交談，她們在某種程度上責怪自己聽從了 Hay 先生的話。兩人都感到被忽視和未被傾聽，但當然，她們將信任寄託在一位在醫學中最個人和敏感領域的外科醫生身上，婦科。\n\n在大型組織中——NHS 是該國最大的雇主——事情會出錯，但問題始終是系統和流程是否足夠健全以發現不良表現，當問題暴露出來並且同事發聲時，管理層是否做得足夠？在 Hay 案中，現在顯然可以做得更多，應該做得更多。\n\n現在將審查更多的案例。對這位 NHS 顧問的工作及其雇主處理方式的審查仍在繼續。","explanation":{"vocabulary":[{"pos":"noun","word_en":"hysterectomy","word_zh":"子宮切除術","definition_en":"A surgical operation to remove all or part of the

This is the context.</p><p class=\"ssrcss-1q0x1qg-Paragraph e1jhz7w10\">England are the best-funded women's rugby team on Earth. They have 32 players on full-time contracts.

Since full-time contracts were introduced in 2019, the Red Roses have won 73 of the 75 matches they have played.</p><p class=\"ssrcss-1q0x1qg-Paragraph e1jhz7w10\">England also has the best league in the world.</p><p class=\"ssrcss-1q0x1qg-Paragraph e1jhz7w10\">The nine-team PWR attracts talent from around the globe, creating a quality and quantity of rugby unrivalled in any other domestic competition and a production line of future Red Roses.</p><p class=\"ssrcss-1q0x1qg-Paragraph e1jhz7w10\">Canada have none of this.</p></div></div><div class=\"ssrcss-bq6git-ComponentWrapper ep2nwvo2\"><div class=\"ssrcss-13blcbn\"><p class=\"ssrcss-1nujjtw\"><strong>Women's Rugby World Cup final: England v Canada</strong></p><div class=\"ssrcss-1n1aq1g\"><p class=\"ssrcss-1q0x1qg-Paragraph e1jhz7w10\">Saturday, 27 September at 16:00 BST</p><p class=\"ssrcss-1q0x1qg-Paragraph e1jhz7w10\">Allianz Stadium, Twickenham</p></div><div class=\"ssrcss-x9kbxm\"><a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/iplayer\" class=\"ssrcss-d4jxq3-CallToActionLink esxl4sy1\"><span data-testid=\"service-identifiers:iplayer\" class=\"ssrcss-fvm71w-IconWrapper esxl4sy0\"></span><span class=\"call-to-action-link-text-wrapper\">Watch on iPlayer</span></a><a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/sounds\" class=\"ssrcss-d4jxq3-CallToActionLink esxl4sy1\"><span data-testid=\"service-identifiers:sounds\" class=\"ssrcss-fvm71w-IconWrapper esxl4sy0\"></span><span class=\"call-to-action-link-text-wrapper\">Listen on Sounds</span></a></div><div class=\"ssrcss-130u6fi\"><p class=\"ssrcss-1q0x1qg-Paragraph e1jhz7w10\">Live on BBC One, BBC Radio 5 Live and the BBC Sport website and app</p></div></div></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"ssrcss-suhx0k-RichTextComponentWrapper ep2nwvo0\"><div class=\"ssrcss-1o5p6v2-RichTextContainer e5tfeyi1\"><p class=\"ssrcss-1q0x1qg-Paragraph e1jhz7w10\">This week, Rugby Canada <a href=\"https://www.cbc.ca/sports/rugby/women-rugby-world-cup-canada-surprise-final-cep-1.7641120\" class=\"ssrcss-k8mrr8-InlineLink e1kn3p7n0\">chief executive Nathan Bombrys estimated</a> that if his women's players \"did everything this calendar year\", they could expect to earn 12,000 Canadian dollars (£6,420) from the national body.</p><p class=\"ssrcss-1q0x1qg-Paragraph e1jhz7w10\">The Rugby Football Union committed a combined £28.7m to its national teams - men and women - in its most recent annual report.

And what the numbers show.</p><p class=\"ssrcss-1q0x1qg-Paragraph e1jhz7w10\">Canada have dug deep for their women's team. It is just their pockets are comparatively shallow.</p><p class=\"ssrcss-1q0x1qg-Paragraph e1jhz7w10\">Rugby Canada funds its men's and women's teams equally - something few, if any, other unions around the world can say.</p><p class=\"ssrcss-1q0x1qg-Paragraph e1jhz7w10\">Head coach Kevin Rouet explained the rest of their philosophy, with a caveat.</p><p class=\"ssrcss-1q0x1qg-Paragraph e1jhz7w10\">\"We try to be that creative because when you don't have money you have to be creative in the way you prepare,\" he said.</p><p class=\"ssrcss-1q0x1qg-Paragraph e1jhz7w10\">\"I think it allows us to do a lot of stuff that we wouldn't be able to do if we had too much money.</p><p class=\"ssrcss-1q0x1qg-Paragraph e1jhz7w10\">\"I know it's crazy to say that, but sometimes it allows us to be to find the best of everything and try to just be efficient with everything.</p><p class=\"ssrcss-1q0x1qg-Paragraph e1jhz7w10\">\"But I want more money, if that wasn't clear!\"</p><p class=\"ssrcss-1q0x1qg-Paragraph e1jhz7w10\">Pamphinette Buisa, who was selected in Rouet's squad but withdrew after suffering an injury in their final warm-up match against Ireland, says similar.</p><p class=\"ssrcss-1q0x1qg-Paragraph e1jhz7w10\">\"We want the support, we want the resources,\" <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/reel/DO523J8jjfL/\" class=\"ssrcss-k8mrr8-InlineLink e1kn3p7n0\">she said in a social media post.</a></p><p class=\"ssrcss-1q0x1qg-Paragraph e1jhz7w10\">\"A win wouldn't prove that professionalism doesn't matter.

With more money, and the subsequent increased depth, cohesion and conditioning, they would have a great chance.</p><p class=\"ssrcss-1q0x1qg-Paragraph e1jhz7w10\">If Australia, New Zealand, South Africa, United States, France or Ireland want to be England's primary rival in a growing game, stalling on cycle-wide spending is only going to make that goal less likely.</p><p class=\"ssrcss-1q0x1qg-Paragraph e1jhz7w10\">And to reduce England's return on investment to the number of shiny pots in the cabinet also seems short-sighted.</p><p class=\"ssrcss-1q0x1qg-Paragraph e1jhz7w10\">A Rugby World Cup victory would be huge, super-charging the growth of the sport.</p><p class=\"ssrcss-1q0x1qg-Paragraph e1jhz7w10\">But the success or failure of a policy can't be entirely decided by a match that may turn on the bounce of a ball or, as in the last Rugby World Cup final, a first-half clash of heads.</p><p class=\"ssrcss-1q0x1qg-Paragraph e1jhz7w10\">England's money has delivered a dominant, excellent team, that draws crowds, sponsors, spectators, players and attention to the game like no other.</p><p class=\"ssrcss-1q0x1qg-Paragraph e1jhz7w10\">The Red Roses will go into the next World Cup in Australia in 2029 as one of, if not the, favourites.</p><p class=\"ssrcss-1q0x1qg-Paragraph e1jhz7w10\">While the Rugby Football Union has invested financially, England have thousands of fans invested emotionally.</p><p class=\"ssrcss-1q0x1qg-Paragraph e1jhz7w10\">That investment doesn't glitter like a World Cup, but it is just as rare a commodity.

2019, while Canada has had to rely on community support and fundraising to compete.\n- Despite financial disparities, Canada's performance on the field has been impressive, showing that strategic

She says they are being plagued by \"an urban street gang made up of quite a high number of young girls\".</p><p>\"What we need to be doing is also putting the parents more on the record for some of this stuff too so perhaps some change in legislation that does make parents much more accountable.\"</p><figure><img src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/3f2e/live/3a5e2fe0-992b-11f0-928c-71dbb8619e94.jpg.webp\" alt=\"A woman with long blonde hair, in a pink blazer, stands in an empty town square, looking at the camera.\"></figure><p>Authorities already possess a range of powers, including civil injunctions, community protection notices, dispersal orders and criminal behaviour orders - the original antisocial behaviour order (ASBO) was replaced in 2014.

She's refusing to leave a shop caught at the centre of a prolonged campaign of antisocial behaviour - windows smashed, items stolen, fires started, staff threatened and attacked.\n\nMuhammad Usman, owner of the mobile phone store in Shirley, near Southampton, is filming her on his own phone - and her juvenile bravado is in full flow. \"Touch me and I'll get you done for assault,\" she warns him.\n\n\"It's getting worse, day by day,\" Muhammad later tells us from behind his till. His voice cracks, clearly worn down by months of abuse - including, he says, a threat by a teenager to kill him. \"I've never had this kind of experience in my life before. We're feeling so helpless.\"\n\nWhat Muhammad and other shopkeepers have experienced over recent months captures the challenge antisocial behaviour poses to police, councils and communities at a time when the government has said tackling it is a key priority.\n\nThree doors down, on the same High Street, Nnenna Okonkwo is also feeling under siege. \"It's ridiculous that it's just a couple of teenagers causing this mayhem,\" she says through tears.\n\nBut these don't seem to be hooded gangsters armed with weapons. When I eventually encounter the gang, I'm faced with a 14-year-old girl in pink leggings and Crocs. \"I'm not claiming to be innocent because I'm not,\" she tells us. \"I've threatened people and I've hit people, I'll admit to that.\"\n\nHer mouth is blue with bubblegum and expletives. \"The second you get into one bit of trouble with the police, you fall into it too deep and you can't get out,\" she adds.\n\nShe says an injury forced her to give up sport and that behaving badly offers an alternative energy release. \"I found that I get the same adrenaline boost from being in trouble with the police and being missing and stuff.\"\n\nBut there's little remorse. \"I regret what I do, but I don't say sorry,\" she says to cheers from the rest of the gang.\n\nShe seems bright but deeply troubled. She admits drinking and she's vaping while we talk. Muhammad had already told us he had experienced racist abuse - something the girl firmly denies being involved in.\n\nOne of her friends chimes in. \"I know what we're doing is wrong but we're teenage kids, we're going to have a bit of fun,\" she tells us. \"I'm sorry for most of the people we have damaged, but I have no sympathy… it's just one way of taking my anger out.\"\n\nLabour was elected last year promising new \"respect orders\" to ban similarly persistent offenders from town centres. Due to be introduced under the Crime and Policing Bill currently going through Parliament, breaching the orders would be a criminal offence with potential penalties including a two-year prison sentence, unlimited fines, or unpaid work.\n\nThat would partially replace existing civil injunction powers. But the respect orders would not apply to under-18s. An amendment aims to bring that down to 16, but would still not apply to anyone younger.\n\nMinisters have also promised more neighbourhood policing. In Shirley, Muhammad's complaint is not the number of officers, but their apparent lack of power or willingness to tackle the teenagers. \"You don't see any action against them,\" he says. \"You feel they are above the law.\"\n\n'We need to be more robust'\n\nThe local beat officer, PC Tom Byrne, says he recognises the concern and that antisocial behaviour is being dealt with.\n\n\"We do need to remember we are dealing with young people,\" he told BBC News in July, saying that while \"there will be consequences\", these need to be appropriate when it comes to children.\n\nSuch instincts to keep young people away from the criminal justice system are deep-rooted in policing - perhaps in the hope antisocial behaviour fizzles out. However, the problem has got worse over the long, hot summer of 2025.\n\nBehaviour like this isn't just happening on one High Street, and it's not just teenagers. A few miles along the south coast in Portsmouth, Neil Gibson knows the cost of repeated antisocial behaviour. His car repair business has been hit repeatedly, he believes by the same group of young men. Security camera footage shows one hooded youth hammering a windscreen with a broom until it smashes.\n\nNeil spends some evenings remotely checking his security cameras from home. \"I did phone [the police] and say look, if you send someone now, you'll catch them - perfect situation. I'm afraid they weren't interested.\"\n\nDisheartened, he says he no longer reports every incident.\n\nIn nearby Fratton, a former industrial part of Portsmouth now largely residential, we see what the police are up against.\n\nPatrolling the cemetery one evening, PC Chris Middleton attempts to stop a young man zipping down a footpath on an electric scooter - but the masked figure simply ignores the constable and speeds off.\n\nWe ask PC Middleton if he can see why some people believe the police are powerless. \"Yeah, I feel it,\" he says. \"At times I really do feel that we need to be more robust and we need more support from the government to tackle these things.\"\n\nA short while later, a convicted shoplifter who is wanted on recall to prison walks past - he is searched and arrested.\n\nIt's a similar story for councils, many of whom across the country are using community wardens to keep a grip on antisocial behaviour. Jason, a warden for Portsmouth City Council, tells us \"a lot of police stuff is being downgraded to antisocial behaviour\", multiplying his workload.\n\nCllr Matt Boughton, chair of the Local Government Association's safer and stronger communities committee, has a similar view - telling BBC News that councils \"are increasingly having to step in when police resources are stretched…putting extra pressure on already stretched councils, pressure which is unsustainable\".\n\nHow can these issues in the communities we've visited - and many others like them across the country - really be solved, then?\n\n'I regret all of it'\n\nSomeone whose role involves working alongside the wider criminal justice system is Donna Jones, Hampshire's police and crime commissioner (PCC). The former Conservative councillor feels the police need a change of approach to dealing with youths and their parents.\n\n\"I think the response from the police, to be absolutely honest with you, has been to take a slightly slower approach but some of these young people are committing some really horrible, nasty offences,\" she tells us while visiting shopkeepers in Shirley. She says they are being plagued by \"an urban street gang made up of quite a high number of young girls\".\n\n\"What we need to be doing is also putting the parents more on the record for some of this stuff too so perhaps some change in legislation that does make parents much more accountable.\"\n\nAuthorities already possess a range of powers, including civil injunctions, community protection notices, dispersal orders and criminal behaviour orders - the original antisocial behaviour order (ASBO) was replaced in 2014. They can also fine parents and even remove social housing.\n\nBut not all of these are applicable to children, and using the ones which are, at scale, will end up criminalising more children. Such measures require time and evidence to obtain, straddling police and councils and concerning often vulnerable young people.\n\nThere have been arrests. A teenager has now been charged with 22 offences, including assault, theft, arson, criminal damage, breaching a dispersal order and racially aggravated harassment. After missing an earlier hearing the teen appeared at Southampton Youth Court last week and is due to appear again next month.\n\nAfter months of persistent antisocial behaviour, the situation in Shirley has calmed down in recent weeks.\n\nResponding to the BBC, Policing Minister Sarah Jones said \"for too long, people have not seen police patrolling their streets\". She said \"this government has increased police patrols in high-crime areas across the country through our Safer Streets Summer Initiative\".\n\nPledging 3,000 more neighbourhood police on the beat by March 2026, she said \"we are sending a clear message: crime will be punished\".\n\nAnd on Thursday the prime minister is due to announce measures to give communities more power to \"seize boarded shops\" and \"block gambling and vape shops on their High Street\".\n\nHampshire Police told us it had \"endeavoured to respond to as many reports as possible\" of antisocial behaviour on Shirley High Street but \"had to ensure this was balanced against the increase in emergency calls\" over the summer months.\n\nAway from the mayhem, we did find some more positive news. As the summer draws to a close and kids return to school, Jaiden, 15, recalls the hours he spent in a police cell after being arrested. From the sofa of his home in Shirley, he tells us he was causing trouble at shops \"nearly every day\".\n\n\"It was fun getting people mad but then I realised after a while it wasn't.\"\n\nHis mum Kylie says she pleaded with the police to act, having felt she'd lost her son to peer pressure. \"Two or three times I asked them 'just arrest him'. They said we can't due to his age, we're going to just have to bring him home. There's not much we can do.\"\n\nHe reads the list of rules he and his mum have since signed in a voluntary \"acceptable behaviour contract\". They include him not stealing, making threats, or using foul or abusive language and leaving shops when ordered. If he complies, he can avoid court.\n\nJaiden vows to never go back to that way of life. \"I regret all of it,\" he says.\n\nMore on this story\n\n'Every night there is banging on our walls'\n\nFlats residents 'trapped' by anti-social behaviour\n\nLondon anti-social behaviour hotspots named by Met\n\nSouthampton\n\nHampshire & Isle of Wight","cleaned_text_zh":"「隨便拍我」——無懼警察的少女騷擾一條商業街\n\n這名青少年的無敵感覺顯而易見。「警察永遠不會幫你，」她說，「你可以隨便拍我。」她拒絕離開一家商店，該商店正處於長期反社會行為的中心——窗戶被砸，物品被偷，火災被點燃，員工受到威脅和攻擊。\n\n位於南安普敦附近的雪莉，手機店的店主穆罕默德·烏斯曼正在用自己的手機拍攝她——她的年少無畏表現得淋漓盡致。「碰我一下，我就告你襲擊，」她警告他。\n\n「情況一天比一天糟，」穆罕默德後來在收銀台後告訴我們。他的聲音顯得沙啞，顯然是被數月的虐待磨損了——包括，他說，一名青少年威脅要殺死他。「我從未有過這樣的經歷。我們感到如此無助。」\n\n穆罕默德和其他店主在過去幾個月中所經歷的事情，反映了反社會行為在政府表示將其作為重點優先事項時，對警察、議會和社區構成的挑戰。\n\n在同一條商業街上，三扇門之外，恩內娜·奧孔科也感到被圍困。「荒謬的是，這只是幾個青少年造成的混亂，」她流著淚說。\n\n但這些似乎不是持有武器的蒙面幫派。當我最終遇到這個幫派時，我面對的是一個穿著粉紅色緊身褲和洞洞鞋的14歲女孩。「我不聲稱自己是無辜的，因為我不是，」她告訴我們。「我威脅過人，也打過人，我承認這一點。」\n\n她的嘴巴因泡泡糖和髒話而變藍。「一旦你和警察有一點麻煩，你就會陷得太深，無法自拔，」她補充道。\n\n她說，受傷迫使她放棄運動，而行為不端提供了一種替代的能量釋放。「我發現從與警察的麻煩中以及失蹤等事情中獲得同樣的腎上腺素激增。」\n\n但幾乎沒有悔意。「我後悔我所做的事，但我不會說對不起，」她在幫派其他成員的歡呼聲中說。\n\n她看起來聰明但深受困擾。她承認喝酒，並在我們交談時吸電子煙。穆罕默德已經告訴我們，他曾經遭受過種族歧視的虐待——這是女孩堅決否認參與的事情。\n\n她的一個朋友插話說。「我知道我們所做的是錯的，但我們是青少年，我們會玩得開心，」她告訴我們。「我為我們傷害的大多數人感到抱歉，但我沒有同情心……這只是我發洩憤怒的一種方式。」\n\n工黨去年當選時承諾引入新的「尊重令」，以禁止類似的持續違法者進入市中心。根據目前正在議會審議的《犯罪與警務法案》，違反這些命令將構成刑事犯罪，可能的懲罰包括兩年監禁、無限罰款或無償工作。\n\n這將部分取代現有的民事禁令權力。但尊重令不適用於18歲以下的人。一項修正案旨在將年齡降至16歲，但仍不適用於更年輕的人。\n\n部長們還承諾加強社區警務。在雪莉，穆罕默德的抱怨不是警察人數，而是他們顯然缺乏權力或意願來應對青少年。「你看不到對他們的任何行動，」他說。「你覺得他們凌駕於法律之上。」\n\n「我們需要更強硬」\n\n當地的巡邏警官湯姆·伯恩警官說，他認識到這一擔憂，並且反社會行為正在得到處理。\n\n「我們需要記住，我們正在與年輕人打交道，」他在7月告訴BBC新聞，說「會有後果」，但這些後果在涉及兒童時需要適當。\n\n這種將年輕人排除在刑事司法系統之外的本能在警務中根深蒂固——也許是希望反社會行為會消失。然而，問題在2025年漫長炎熱的夏季中變得更糟。\n\n這種行為不僅發生在一條商業街上，也不僅僅是青少年。在南海岸的幾英里外，朴茨茅斯的尼爾·吉布森知道反社會行為反復發生的代價。他的汽車修理業務多次遭到襲擊，他相信是同一群年輕人所為。監控攝像頭拍攝到一名蒙面青年用掃帚敲打擋風玻璃直到它破碎。\n\n尼爾有時晚上會在家遠程查看他的監控攝像頭。「我打電話給[警察]說，看看，如果你現在派人來，你就能抓住他們——完美的情況。我怕他們不感興趣。」\n\n心灰意冷，他說他不再報告每一起事件。\n\n在附近的弗拉特頓，朴茨茅斯的一個前工業區現在主要是住宅區，我們看到警察面臨的挑戰。\n\n一個晚上，克里斯·米德爾頓警官在墓地巡邏，試圖阻止一名年輕人騎著電動滑板車沿著小路疾馳——但蒙面人物只是無視警官，迅速駛離。\n\n我們問米德爾頓警官是否能理解為什麼有些人認為警察無能為力。「是的，我感覺到了，」他說。「有時我真的覺得我們需要更強硬，我們需要政府更多的支持來解決這些問題。」\n\n不久之後，一名被定罪的商店扒手因被召回監獄而被通緝，他被搜查並逮捕。\n\n對於議會來說，情況類似，全國許多議會正在使用社區巡邏員來控制反社會行為。朴茨茅斯市議會的巡邏員傑森告訴我們，「很多警察的事情被降級為反社會行為」，增加了他的工作量。\n\n地方政府協會的安全和強大社區委員會主席馬特·博頓議員持有類似觀點——告訴BBC新聞，議會「越來越多地在警察資源緊張時介入……給已經緊張的議會增加了額外的壓力，這種壓力是不可持續的」。\n\n那麼，我們訪問過的社區以及全國許多類似的社區中的這些問題如何才能真正得到解決呢？\n\n「我後悔所有的事情」\n\n一位角色涉及與更廣泛的刑事司法系統合作的人是漢普郡的警察和犯罪專員（PCC）唐娜·瓊斯。這位前保守黨議員認為警察需要改變對待青少年及其父母的方法。\n\n「老實說，我認為警察的反應是採取稍微慢一點的方法，但其中一些年輕人正在犯下一些非常可怕、惡劣的罪行，」她在訪問雪莉的店主時告訴我們。她說，他們被「由相當多的年輕女孩組成的城市街頭幫派」所困擾。\n\n「我們需要做的是也讓父母更多地記錄這些事情，也許一些立法的變化會讓父母更加負責。」\n\n當局已經擁有一系列權力，包括民事禁令、社區保護通知、驅散令和刑事行為令——原始的反社會行為令（ASBO）在2014年被取代。他們還可以對父母罰款，甚至取消社會住房。\n\n但並非所有這些都適用於兒童，並且大規模使用那些適用的措施將最終使更多兒童犯罪化。這些措施需要時間和證據來獲得，跨越警察和議會，並涉及通常是弱勢的年輕人。\n\n已經有逮捕行動。一名青少年現已被控22項罪名，包括襲擊、盜竊、縱火、刑事損壞、違反驅散令和種族加重騷擾。在錯過早些時候的聽證會後，這名青少年上週在南安普敦青年法院出庭，並將於下月再次出庭。\n\n在數月的持續反社會行為之後，雪莉的情況在最近幾周有所緩和。\n\n應BBC的要求，警務部長薩拉·瓊斯表示，「太久以來，人們沒有看到警察在他們的街道上巡邏」。她說，「通過我們的安全街道夏季倡議，政府已經增加了全國高犯罪率地區的警察巡邏」。\n\n承諾到2026年3月再增加3000名社區警察，她說，「我們正在傳達一個明確的信息：犯罪將受到懲罰」。\n\n週四，首相將宣布措施，賦予社區更多權力「沒收封閉的商店」和「阻止賭博和電子煙商店進入他們的商業街」。\n\n漢普郡警察告訴我們，他們已經「努力回應儘可能多的報告」，關於雪莉商業街的反社會行為，但「必須確保這與夏季緊急電話的增加保持平衡」。\n\n遠離混亂，我們確實發現了一些更積極的消息。隨著夏天結束，孩子們返回學校，15歲的傑登回憶起他被捕後在警察局度過的幾個小時。在他位於雪莉的家中的沙發上，他告訴我們，他幾乎每天都在商店裡惹麻煩。\n\n「讓人生氣很有趣，但後來我意識到這並不有趣。」\n\n他的媽媽凱莉說，她懇求警察採取行動，因為她覺得她的兒子受到了同齡人的壓力。「我兩三次要求他們『就逮捕他』。他們說我們不能因為他的年齡，我們只能把他帶回家。我們無能為力。」\n\n他讀著他和媽媽簽署的自願「可接受行為合同」上的規則。這些規則包括他不偷竊、不威脅、不使用粗俗或侮辱性語言，並在被命令時離開商店。如果他遵守，他可以避免上法庭。\n\n傑登發誓永遠不再回到那種生活方式。「我後悔所有的事情，」他說。\n\n更多相關故事\n\n「每晚都有敲打我們牆壁的聲音」\n\n公寓居民被反社會行為「困住」\n\n倫敦反社會行為熱點由大都會警察命名\n\n南安普敦\n\n漢普郡和懷特島","explanation":{"vocabulary":[{"pos":"noun","word_en":"bravado","word_zh":"虛張聲勢","definition_en":"A bold manner or a show of boldness intended to impress or intimidate.","definition_zh":"一種大膽的舉止或表現，旨在給人留下深刻印象或威嚇他人。","example_en":"His bravado did not impress the judges.","example_zh":"他的虛張聲勢並沒有打動法官。"},{"pos":"noun","word_en":"remorse","word_zh":"悔恨","definition_en":"Deep regret or guilt for a wrong committed.","definition_zh":"對所犯錯誤的深深懊悔或內疚。","example_en":"She felt remorse for her harsh words.","example_zh":"她對自己的苛刻言辭感到悔恨。"},{"pos":"noun","word_en":"injunction","word_zh":"禁令","definition_en":"An authoritative warning or order.","definition_zh":"一種權威的警告或命令。","example_en":"The court issued an injunction to stop the construction.","example_zh":"法院發出禁令以停止施工。"}],"grammar":[{"rule_en":"Reported Speech","explanation_en":"Reported speech is used to tell someone what another person said.
